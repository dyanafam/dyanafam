- 👋 Hi, I’m @dyanafam
- 👀 I’m interested in economics and politics, especially in how the interdiscipline study of them might improve our global society and solve urgent inequality issues. I also follow the energy industry closely, as it is tied with how we are shaping the world for the future generations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NLP dan data scrapping for exciting economics project. Social media is truly a gold mine for high frequency, user-generated sentiment data. As an economist at heart, I believe us economists need to equip ourselves with artificial intelligence tools such as NLP and machine learning to make use of the readily-available data. Data is the new oil, it would be a waste to pass on this opportunity, no? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting NLP projects I have in mind.
